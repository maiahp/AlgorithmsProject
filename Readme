# Contains efficient algorithm

# processfile.py
# grabs data from input and output files in ./SampleTestCases

# main.py
# unit testing program with different tests to ensure correctness of program

# plotter.py
# After running ./run_it_all.sh grabs output data from the output files created(in out_basic and out_efficient folders) and presents it for easy copy and paste for plotting 
# Note: printed in form: (m+n, time_data_basic, time_data_efficient)
                     and (m+n, memory_data_basic, memory_data_efficient)
# Run as: python3 plotter.py
